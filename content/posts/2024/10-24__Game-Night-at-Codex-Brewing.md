[Codex Brewing](https://www.codexbrewing.com) hosted this week's tabletop game
night. It is a very cool micro-brew not far from North Canton with some
excellent and interesting brews on tap.

Given that Halloween is just around the corner, we played a fun game of
[Betrayal at the House on the
Hill](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill).
This is a spooky, coop, where you get to explore a haunted mansion, looking for
clues and items, until one of the team turns against the party.  My character
immediately became ensnared in giant webs, but was able to free himself in a few
turns.  The party was able to explore much of the house, until one of us fell
asleep and then a number of ghosts appeared and dashed out of the house,
failing to stop them, well, it was curtains.

A number of other games were played at the other table:
