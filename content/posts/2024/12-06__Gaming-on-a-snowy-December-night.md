Thanks goes out to [Muskellunge Brewing Company](https://muskellungebrewingcompany.com/) for
hosting the Canton Tabletop game night on Thursday, December 5, 2024. It was a
wintery night but fun was had by all. (It is December in Ohio, snow is to be
expected you know.)

Andy and crew played [Clank Legacy: Acquistions
Inc](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266507/clank-legacy-acquisitions-incorporated)
at table one.

At table two, we played a light-hearted game called [Newfoundland
Jam](https://www.drinkingquest.com/games/newfoundlandjam) (make some friggin'
jam) that I picked up at Gencon one year.  The we then played
[Grifters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168054/grifters), and of course
Jeff one again, like he usually does at that game. We finished the night with a
bizzare game of [Zombie
Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29387/zombie-fluxx). Fluxx is always
strange, but this one started out in a bizzare card cascade.

Hope to see everyone next time!
