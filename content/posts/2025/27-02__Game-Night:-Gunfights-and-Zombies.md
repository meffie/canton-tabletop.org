Thursday night, February 27th, 2025, found our intrepid board game group once
again descending upon the welcoming tables of [Milestone Games][1] in downtown
Canton, Ohio. And what a night it was! The air buzzed with the clatter of dice,
the shuffling of cards, and the occasional triumphant (or despairing) cry.

[Milestone Games][1], as always, provided the perfect backdrop for our weekly
game night. The spacious tables, the friendly atmosphere, and the sheer volume
of games available make it a haven for board game enthusiasts like ourselves.

This particular Thursday saw us splitting into two distinct factions, each
tackling a different tabletop challenge.

## At the "Gunfights & Gamblin'" Table:

One group found themselves immersed in the dusty, high-stakes world of the Wild
West. ["Gunfights & Gamblin'"][2] lived up to its name, promising both tense
shootouts and risky wagers. I heard tales of carefully planned heists gone
awry, of showdowns at high noon, and of fortunes won and lost on the turn of a
card. Particularly, the Renegades where able to pull off a close victory.  They
ended up burning the town down, and sealing their victory with two incredibly
lucky rolls on dynamite explosions! The table was alive with the banter of
cowboys and outlaws, and the occasional frustrated groan as a carefully laid
plan was foiled by a lucky dice roll. It was a perfect blend of strategy and
chance, capturing the spirit of the Old West in a fun and engaging way.

## Meanwhile, at the "Dead of Winter" Table:

The other group braved the harsh, unforgiving world of a zombie apocalypse.
["Dead of Winter"][3] is a game of survival, where players must cooperate to
keep their colony alive while also dealing with personal objectives and the
ever-present threat of betrayal. The atmosphere at this table was thick with
tension, as players debated resource allocation, planned scavenging runs, and
tried to sniff out potential traitors. In the end, despite their best efforts,
the relentless horde proved too much, and the zombies claimed victory, leaving
the colony in ruins. The groans of the undead echoed throughout the room, a
stark reminder of the dangers lurking just outside the colony walls. It was a
masterclass in cooperative gameplay, with a healthy dose of paranoia thrown in
for good measure.

## New Players Always Welcome!

It's important to us that our group remains open and welcoming to everyone.
Whether you're a seasoned tabletop veteran or someone brand new to the hobby,
we'd love to have you join us! We're a friendly bunch, and we're always happy
to teach new games and help newcomers get settled in. Don't be shy – come on
down and roll some dice with us!

## Looking Ahead: Ten Years of Dice and Friendship!

As the night drew to a close, and the final dice were rolled, we packed up our
games and headed out into the cool Canton night, already looking forward to
next week's adventure. But this year carries a special significance for our
group. We’re celebrating our ten-year anniversary in April!

Ten years of shared laughter, strategic victories, and the occasional crushing
defeat. Ten years of building friendships around the tabletop. It’s a testament
to the power of games to bring people together, to create lasting memories, and
to provide a much-needed escape from the everyday.

We are already planning a special celebration for our anniversary, a chance to
look back on a decade of gaming and to look forward to many more years of dice
rolls and camaraderie. Keep an eye out for details as we get closer to April!

A huge thank you to Milestone Gaming for hosting us and to everyone who joined
us for another fantastic night of tabletop fun. Here's to many more Thursdays
filled with games, laughter, and good company!
